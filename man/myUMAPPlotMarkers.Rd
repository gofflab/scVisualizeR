\title{Given an exisiting UMAP embedding of scRNAseq data, returns UMAP embedding colored by the relative expression of marker gene of interest}
\usage{
myUMAPPlotMarkers(
  cds,
  markers = NULL,
  logMode = T,
  shape_by = NULL,
  scaled = FALSE,
  x_cord = "UMAP1",
  y_cord = "UMAP2",
  size = 0.75
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cds}{a cell data set}

\item{markers}{a list of gene short names}

\item{logMode}{choose to log10 transform gene expression counts with a pseudocount of 1}

\item{size}{adjust the size of the points used}

\item{x}{the x coordinates that you would like to use}

\item{y}{the y coordinates that you would like to use}
}
\value{
Returns a facet wrapped UMAP embeddings of the same number as the number of marker genes chosen, colored by relative gene expression
